  "body": "- **Before all**, press the button on the roomintro or type “!pick Seasonal, Colors, Monotype, Monogen, Regular, Eevee” if Catch & Evolve (C&E) is voted as the next tournament.\r\n\r\n- Begin the desired tour by using the appropriate bot commands found in the staff intro or click <<here>>. The bot will automatically create the tournament. Please **do not forget** to add your name as the host to the commands!\r\n\r\n- If you are the desired host of the tournament, please type the command “.cehost [username]” after different periods of people talking in the room and joining the tournament. The bot will do it for you when you follow the bot C&E commands, but .cehost is for repeat purposes.\r\n\r\n- If you are the host and joined the tournament, you must random pick your starter(s) in public by using the first command in Step 5!\r\n\r\nYour main job as a host is to assign starters to tournament players when they message you for one. This is normally done before the tournament starts, but you can start it once it hits its full capacity. The only C&E tour that has no host to give out starters is Eevee. **Everyone is allowed one reroll if they ask for it**. Here are your options for choosing starters:\r\nUse the command “/randpoke lc, [desired C&E format]”\r\nRefer to the room’s Random Generator - The random generator can do most types of C&E formats (monoregion = monogen). The exception is Seasonal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### C&E Information & Banlist:\r\n\r\n\r\n.cehelp - This is C&E, a tier in which there is a host who gives you one random LC mon, and you start out with it in the tour. If you win a battle, you get to choose one of the loser's pokes and the winner can evolve one of their pokes. Remember that Focus Sash is banned in the First Round.\r\n\r\n.cebanlist - Current C&E Banlist: Weedle, caterpie, Magikarp, Igglybuff, Sunkern, Wurmple, Slakoth, Nincada, Feebas, Kricketot, Burmy, Combee, Tynamo, Scatterbug, Happiny, Sentret, Ralts, Torchic\r\n\r\n### Using The Random Generator:\r\n\r\nThe random generator is a helpful and an easy tool to use when hosting Catch & Evolve tournaments and giving out starters. Here is what you do:\r\n\r\n\r\nPick the format of the C&E tournament that was chosen when you did !pick in Step 1. This will be the first box/option on the generator. It will do most C&E formats. The only exception is Seasonal.\r\nIf you have to do, Monogen/Monoregion, Monotype, or Monocolor then a second box will appear below the format box. It will either say “Region, Type, or Color”. A second box will not appear for the other formats.\r\nMake sure the number of participants is set to eight. Remember to reroll when you enter an username. Keep the generator & list up until the tournament is over.\r\n\r\n### HOW TO PLAY EACH TIER:\r\n\r\n**Regular** -\r\nYour typical, normal C&E. Nothing special, move along. Use the generator and refer to .cebanlist. \r\n\r\n**Eevee** -\r\nEveryone gets an Eevee. (thus allowing you to break the Species Clause for this kind of tour) and you may choose to evolve it into any Eeveelution. There is no host. Just tell people to only use ONE eevee.\r\n\r\n**Monotype** -\r\nJust what it sounds like. It is a Monotype version of C&E! Please use the the generator and follow it’s instructions above.\r\n\r\n**Monogen / Monoregion** -\r\nAlso straightforward. All starters come from the same generation/region of the host’s choice, or !roll 6.  The generator will do Monogen for you, but it is listed as Monoregion in the types of C&E formats.\r\n\r\n**Color**:\r\nAll starters given will be of certain color(s) that are decided by the host or picked randomly thru !pick red,blue,yellow,green,black,brown,purple,gray,white,pink. You can use the generator to do this by changing the format to Monocolor & the color you want.\r\n\r\nHere comes the complicated one-\r\n**Seasonal** -\r\nThe most fun themed C&E’s, but also the most complex. They follow a month by month basis and so here they are. To decide the tier, look at what month it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n- **January**: (Winter) Ice type pokemon will be used.
